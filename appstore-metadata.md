## Description

Train smarter. Think faster. Know yourself.

AXON is a brain training app built around 10 scientifically-inspired cognitive games that challenge your memory, speed, logic, perception, and more. No ads. No subscriptions. No data collection. Just pure cognitive training that works entirely offline.

--- 10 COGNITIVE GAMES ---

Each game targets a specific cognitive domain, designed to push your mental performance:

- SPEED MATH: Race against time to solve arithmetic chains. Builds numerical fluency and processing speed.
- COLOR MATCH: Identify color-word conflicts in a Stroop-inspired challenge. Tests selective attention and inhibitory control.
- FLASH MEMORY: Memorize and recall sequences of visual patterns. Strengthens short-term visual memory.
- PARADOX FLOW: Navigate logical contradictions and conditional reasoning. Sharpens deductive thinking.
- PATTERN HUNTER: Spot the hidden rule in evolving visual sequences. Develops pattern recognition and fluid intelligence.
- OPERATOR CHAOS: Solve equations with missing or scrambled operators. Challenges mathematical reasoning under pressure.
- SPATIAL STACK: Mentally rotate and stack spatial configurations. Builds visuospatial processing ability.
- WORD CONNECT: Form words from letter grids under time constraints. Expands verbal fluency and lexical access.
- SUIT DECEPTION: Track card suits through misleading distractions. Tests working memory and resistance to interference.
- CHIMP MEMORY: Recall numbered positions after a brief flash -- inspired by the famous chimpanzee memory test. Challenges spatial short-term memory.

--- 3 PLAY MODES ---

CLASSIC MODE: A 3-minute timed session across multiple games. Push for your highest composite score.

ENDLESS MODE: Sudden death. One mistake and it's over. How far can you go?

FOCUS MODE: Pick any individual game and train it in isolation. Perfect for targeted improvement.

--- ADAPTIVE DIFFICULTY ---

AXON features a 5-tier adaptive difficulty system that responds to your performance in real time. As you improve, the games get harder. If you struggle, they ease back. Every session stays in your optimal challenge zone.

## Review Notes for Apple

AXON is a fully offline brain training app. It does not require an internet connection, user accounts, or any sign-in process. All 10 games and 3 play modes are immediately accessible on launch. The app uses a local WKWebView to render game content; all assets are bundled within the app binary and no network requests are made. No special configuration or demo account is needed to review the app.
